I wanted a better way for me and my friends to find songs that two or more people both love. So I created a social app
that lets us individually build our favorite song lists, and then see which songs we have in common. You can then join
one or more groups, and within each group you basically see a venn-diagram of songs that you and the other group members
all like. This way, you can easily find songs that you can sing together.

The app is built with Next.js (app dir), Turso as database with Drizzle as ORM.

Very fun app to build, but the amount of time spent on it is probably not worth the usefulness of the app. :) But that's
true for most of my projects.
