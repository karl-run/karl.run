<GaugeCollection values={meta.projectValues} direction="row" />

A quick [Deno](https://deno.land/) script to check if there are any available tables at the Oslo based restaurant [Hot Shop](https://www.restauranthotshop.no). It has been fully booked since it won a [Michelin star](https://guide.michelin.com/no/en/oslo-region/oslo/restaurant/hot-shop) in 2022.

The script is pretty simple since the restaurant has a nice API that it's own booking system uses. It's just a matter of checking if there are any available tables at a given day. If there are, it sends a message to a Slack channel.

Then it's a race to book the table.

The CRON part of the script is just a GitHub Action with a cron trigger.
